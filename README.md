# Mission-to-Mars

For this project, we conducted a Web Scraping of various different websites, in order to create a Web App to retrieve and hold key information, facts, images and recent news about Mars and NASA's recent discoveries about the planet.
First, using HTML elements, BeautifulSoup, and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape. Also, create a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape. Next, create a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape. Finally, use Bootstrap components to polish and customize the portfolio.
